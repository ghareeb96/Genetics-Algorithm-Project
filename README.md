# Genetics-Algorithm-Project

a Python project Aims to get a optimal solution of a specific fitness function using Genetics algorithm : 
F(x) = (4 * a * c) – (8 * b * d) + (5 * h * i) − (10 * g * j) + (e * f)
chromosome consists of 10-genes of random [0:9] digits : [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j]
by controling the number of generations entered by the user
creating 3 .txt files contains all the populations and fitness and optimal solution
